## Hi there, I'm Lakindu 👋

* 👀 I’m a prospective PhD student looking for opportunities in Canada and Australia starting in Fall 2026.
* 💼 I'm currently interning at [XLANG Lab](https://xlang.ai/) with [Professor Yu Tao](https://taoyds.github.io/) working on scaling the Vision Language Action (VLA) Model training dataset.
* 📫 Reach me at [lakindujay@gmail.com](mailto:lakindujay@gmail.com). I'd be more than happy to have a chat :D
